## Intro
The idea of this project was to recreate an old one, but at this time using Typescript. I had two options, use the old one and refactor it or create a entirety new project, I chose the last one.

### Homepage
This is a simple project, it get the products from the API, 
renders on the screen and has the function to add the products to the cart,
which is a modal in the upper right corner in this case.
In the modal you can change the quantities of each product, remove them individually or remove them all.

### Login / Register 
Uses react hook form to register a new user to the API and also to login.
Currently using Yup as resolver

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
